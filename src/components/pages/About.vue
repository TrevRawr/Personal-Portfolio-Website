            Hello, My name is <strong>Trevor Clelland</strong>. I am a software developer and a student in the
            <a href='http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html'>Software Systems</a>
            program at <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong> (SFU). I am interested in a wide variety of domains in Computer Science, but regardless of what I am working on,
            my focus is designing high quality, practical, readable, and maintainable code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started programming in high school, but programming was more of a hobby for me until I started university. Since then, I have gained lots of experience. As a student, I have worked on many
            <strong>school projects</strong>; as an employee, I have developed <strong>Android mobile applications</strong> at
            <a href='http://www.pnimedia.com/'>PNI Digital Media</a>; and as an individual, I have worked on numerous <strong>personal software projects</strong>.
            If you would like to learn more about the work I've done, please check out the rest of my website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have a life outside of Computer Science! My hobbies include mountain biking, skiing, playing guitar, video games, and film making.
            As with my "hobby" of programming, I tend to combine my hobbies with my work. As a film maker, I worked on a
            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ3d8Zv0Aa4'>promotional film</a> for a program at SFU. I am also a part of a small group of
            film makers/friends called <a href='http://foxwoodfilms.com/'>Foxwood Films</a>. We primarily produce short films on mountain biking.
          </P>
