          My name is <strong>Trevor Clelland</strong>. I am a software developer and a student in the
          <a href='http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html'>Software Systems</a>
          program at <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong> (SFU). I am interested in a wide variety of domains in Computer Science, but regardless of what I am working on,
          my focus is designing high quality, practical, readable, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started programming in high school, but programming was more of a hobby for me until I started university. Since then, I have gained lots of experience. As a student, I have worked on many
          <strong>school projects</strong>, as an employee, I have developed <strong>Android mobile applications</strong> at
          <a href='http://www.pnimedia.com/'>PNI Digital Media</a>, and as an individual, I have worked on many <strong>personal software projects</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a life outside of Computer Science! My hobbies include mountain biking, skiing, playing guitar, video games, and film making.
          As with my "hobby" of programming, I'm not very good at keeping my hobbies separate from my work. As a film maker, I worked on a
          <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ3d8Zv0Aa4'>promotional film</a> for a program at SFU. I am also a part of a small group of
          film makers/friends called <a href='http://foxwoodfilms.com/'>Foxwood Films</a>. We primarily produce short films on mountain biking
